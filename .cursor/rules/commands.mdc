# Commands

- Use `bun` as the package manager. NEVER use npm, npx, yarn, or pnpm.
- Linting: `bun run lint`
- TypeScript checking: `bun run ts`
- Formatting: `bun run format`
- NEVER run `bun run build` or any build commands. The build WILL fail due to API rate limits.
- NEVER use `npx tsc`, `npx eslint`, or any npx commands. Use `bun run` equivalents instead.
